Brief write up of the steps to connect the components together:

Connecting the link it one to the shield to allow arduino programming and the com port to be connected. When pushing the codes into the hardware, it will test whether each of the sensor is working. Connect the Touch sensor and the RGB at pin touch 3 and RGB display at IRC. Connect the motion sensor and the led light at pin motion 2 and led light pin 4. The pressure sensor has to be connected to the breadboard as it does have the wires to connect directly to the base shield. It includes jumper wires to connect to the sides of the base shield. The potentiometer is to control the sensitivity of the motion sensor as the sensor has very high sensitivity. One of the potentiometer is to control the distance of the sensor to detect the motion and the other is the delay. So if adjusting the potentiometer for the delay, the led light will turn off the light at a longer time. If the delay is short, it will turn off at the quickest time.
